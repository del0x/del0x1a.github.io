# Blog.

Just a blog I created for fun and playing around with. Nothing too serious. Eventual goal is to move this to self-hosted server.

Currently built using staticjinja templates. 

To add a new post, create a new .md file under build_site/notes. Once you're done, run the build.py script to recompile the html and you're done.
